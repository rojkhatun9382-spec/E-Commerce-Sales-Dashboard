# E-Commerce-Sales-Dashboard
This project analyzes sales, profit, customer behavior, and product performance to understand business performance and recommend improvements.
Using detailed category-level, sub-category, product, customer, regional, and time-based analysis, the project identifies key drivers of revenue and areas needing strategic action.

1. Category & Sub-Category Performance

Technology is the highest revenue-generating category, followed by Office Supplies and Furniture. However, several sub-categories such as Fasteners, Labels, and Art have very low sales. High-performing sub-categories like Phones, Chairs, and Storage bring strong revenue, while Tables and Bookcases show losses due to high discounting.

2. Profitability & Discount Impact

Profitability is negatively affected by high discounts. Many products rely heavily on discounting to generate sales, creating profit leakage. Optimizing the discount strategy is crucial for improving overall margins.

3. Top Product Contribution

A small number of top-selling products contribute a large share of total sales. The top 10 products significantly influence overall revenue, with the top 3 having the strongest impact. Ensuring consistent stock and proper pricing for these products is essential.

4. Customer Behavior Insights

Customer contribution is highly uneven — a small group of high-value customers generates most of the revenue. The majority of customers make only a single purchase, resulting in weak customer retention. Increasing repeat purchases should be a priority.

5. Regional Performance

East and West regions perform the strongest in both sales and profit. The South region consistently underperforms, suggesting the need for improved distribution, marketing, and service.

6. Time Series Analysis

Sales peak at the end of the year due to festive and holiday demand. Mid-year months experience lower sales. Seasonal trends should be used to plan inventory and promotions more effectively.
